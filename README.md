## üìå Overview

This repository contains the completed analysis and report for Problem Set 4, which examines how COVID-19 outcomes across U.S. counties were influenced by mask-wearing and vaccination rates in 2022.

The project was completed using R Markdown and includes data preprocessing, visualization, and regression analysis based on the code provided by the data team. The final output is a professionally formatted PDF report.

## üìä Summary of Report Structure

1. **Summary:**  
   Overview of the report's purpose and key findings.

2. **Data:**  
   - Data sources: NYTimes COVID data, CDC vaccination data, NYT mask survey.  
   - Descriptive statistics and visualizations for:
     - COVID-19 death counts
     - Mask usage (% always masking)
     - Vaccination rates

3. **Analysis:**  
   Regression models estimating the effect of mask usage and vaccination on scaled COVID-19 death rates (per 100,000 people), using `felm()` and presented with `gt` tables.

4. **Appendix:**  
   Full R code used for data processing and model estimation.
